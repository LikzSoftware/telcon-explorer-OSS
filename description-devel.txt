[root] - main() functions for normal execution and test runs, some general definitions and helpers; project files; description files for users and for developers;

colorizer - classes and widgets for using and modifying transfer functions (translation of data values to color values); *this package is reused in other VCGL applications;

exploration - model and controller (= main widget) for the interactive part of the application;

exploration/maps - classes and widgets responsible for the map views of the interactive part of the application;

exploration/projection - classes and widgets responsible for the projection view of the interactive part of the application;

init - classes used for the startup of the application (resolving file names, reading data, as well as organizing the startup sequence);

[meta] - supplementary data files required for the application (transfer function presets, land contours);

preferences - classes and widgets for using, modifying and storing/loading the application preferences;

process - classes implementing the correlation computation, region extraction, storing/loading precomputed data;

projection - classes responsible for the computation of the projection; *this package is reused in other VCGL applications
