DOCUMENTATION
* Find out the licences for the used software
	NetCDF
	GSL		GPL

	which mention the used components and their licences
* Generate Doxygen output, verify presence/absence of commentary
* Update .dia UML diagram
* AUTHORS

BUGS TO FIX
* Fix bugs / improve behavior with file locations
	- should not crash on non-existent file

* Remove lines around map subview and legend subview
% Projection view is black on startup until resize
	-> paint is not called neither on construction, nor show, nor update
	-> workaround implemented to resize Â±1 px 
* Default transfer functions -- use ones from the paper
* Region Explorer -- change the dialog title
* Enable / disable points and lines in the views


IMPROVEMENTS
* Switch precomputation files to binary to speed up writes/reads
* Estimate feasibility of a progressbar for projection
* See if it is possible to analyze required dependencies (e.g. libnetcdf-devel / netcdf.h) from qmake

To test:
* Support of Qt v4 and latest Qt v5
* Compilation and execution on Linux and Windows
Tested:
* Compilation and execution on Mac and Qt5.6 -> OK

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
* Create packages structure, e.g.
	VCGL::Geo,
	VCGL::Color,
	VCGL::Projection,
	VCGL::Configuration,
	VCGL::Persistence
* package Colorizer
	- Rename package Colorizer to Colormap?
	- Merge RGBA support by Gordan R?
* Remove/rename color_schemes.txt from colorizer package
* Screenshot to file for widgets
* Screenshot to file for the ensemble of widgets
	AKA "export current state to an image"
* Add preference for the lat/lon showing: file default vs N/S, E/W
* Region Explorer -- add a "console view" with steps tracing, e.g. 
	step 0: thresholding at TC=0.6
	step 1: found first seed: (20N, 180E)
	...
	step 10: no seeds found, stopping search
	found k regions, l links
	... 
* Disable mouse transform of the projection widget
	(possibly make configurable via subclassing)
* Support selecting full grid / Northern Hemisphere / arbitrary grid region
	for computations and exploration
* Custom associations between original data file and precomputation results
	a) precompute all, load Northern Hemisphere
	b) recognize single variable / single level files
		AND point all launch types to the same precomputation files
		(with/without variable name, with/without level)
